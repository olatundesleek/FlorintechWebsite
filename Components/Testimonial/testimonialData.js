    review:
      "If you are looking for a place to become literate in computing, not just literacy, becoming skilled in your chosen area of computing, then you're at the right place. A productive learning environment, collaboration with like minds,teacher-student relationship is at the optimum and having teachers that are ready to teach in the most understanding manner, in different ways and at different times is the norm here. It's near impossible to leave here the same way you  came. Words don't cut it, your first-hand experience will do the trick.",

    review:
      "Jumped in head first, what an experience ,I decided it was time for a career change, but didn't know the first thing about tech, the instructors are amazing, and never failed to help me through things I didn't understand. As the weeks went by, my confidence and passion for web development grew. The PRACTICAL and labs were challenging, but you have not only the instructors to help you, but also your classmates. Being in a smaller breakout group allowed us to tackle certain tasks as a team. We learned a lot together, and even remained friends after class was over.",
